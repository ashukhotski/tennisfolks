Unfinished project I had been working on in 2016. 

It should have become the next generation tennis app to organize competitions among amateurs as well as find nearby practice partners (the concept of Tinder for tennis players).

I utilized Java tech stack (JAX-RS, EJB, JPA + Hibernate) to build REST API, and integrated it with AngularJS web client. I planned to develop iOS and Android clients, but at some point decided to dissolve the startup.
